        <p>Apart from being a software engineer, I am an avid snowboarder.  I won three national snowboard titles in 2008, 2009, and 2010, and placed third in 2007.  I am very competative, and had to lose!  In the summer, I enjoy spending time with family in Harbor Springs and golfing.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">When mother nature does not cooperate with me, I am a fan of sci-fi, specifically Star Trek.  My favorite video games series is The Elder Scrolls, Oblivion being my favorite entry.  I also am a singer songwriter for a band in the metro Detroit area.</p>
